1. Bezier Curve: It smootgens the given dataset using bezier curve fitting(dataset could be anything image video..etc...all maths is implemented by myself)

2. Fourier Series: It helps to find fourier of image for further mathematical operations.

3. Image Decomposition: It helps to reduce image quality and blur to make image fit for machine learning using convolutions and 2d fft and ifft.

4. Maze: A maze solving algorithm using A*(a star) pathfinder.

5. Fern: A visualization of fractal that creates fern.

6. Image: It applies B-spline and bezier curve to increase the quality of image.
